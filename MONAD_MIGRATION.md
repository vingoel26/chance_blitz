# Monad Migration Guide

This guide explains the changes made to migrate this dApp from Ethereum to Monad blockchain.

## What is Monad?

Monad is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain that's fully EVM-compatible but with parallel execution capabilities. It offers:
- 10,000+ TPS (Transactions Per Second)
- Sub-second finality
- Full EVM compatibility
- Parallel transaction processing

## Changes Made

### 1. Network Configuration
- Added Monad testnet and mainnet configurations to `hardhat.config.js`
- Chain IDs: 1337 (testnet), 1338 (mainnet)
- RPC URLs: `https://rpc.testnet.monad.xyz` and `https://rpc.monad.xyz`

### 2. Smart Contract Optimizations
- Enhanced `Mines.sol` with better event logging
- Added `getContractBalance()` function for monitoring
- Optimized for parallel execution patterns

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Created `monad-config.js` for network management
- Added automatic network switching functionality
- Updated components to check for Monad network connection
- Enhanced user experience with network validation

### 4. Deployment Scripts
- Added Monad-specific deployment scripts
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Network-aware deployment process

## How to Deploy to Monad

### Prerequisites
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your private key
   ```

### Deploy to Monad Testnet
```bash
npm run hardhat:deploy:monad-testnet
```

### Deploy to Monad Mainnet
```bash
npm run hardhat:deploy:monad-mainnet
```

## Network Switching

The dApp now automatically:
1. Checks if connected to Monad network
2. Prompts user to switch if not connected
3. Handles network addition to MetaMask
4. Validates network connection before transactions

## Key Benefits of Monad

1. **Performance**: 10,000+ TPS vs Ethereum's ~15 TPS
2. **Cost**: Lower gas fees due to parallel processing
3. **Compatibility**: Full EVM compatibility means no code changes needed
4. **User Experience**: Faster transaction confirmations

## Testing on Monad

1. Get testnet MONAD tokens from Monad faucet
2. Deploy contracts to testnet
3. Test all game functionality
4. Verify transaction speeds and costs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MetaMask Network Not Found**
   - The dApp will automatically add Monad networks
   - Manual addition: Add network with chain ID 1337 (testnet) or 1338 (mainnet)

2. **Transaction Failures**
   - Ensure sufficient MONAD balance
   - Check gas limits (Monad uses different gas pricing)

3. **Contract Deployment Issues**
   - Verify private key in .env file
   - Check RPC endpoint connectivity
   - Ensure sufficient testnet MONAD for deployment

## Next Steps

1. Test thoroughly on Monad testnet
2. Deploy to Monad mainnet when available
3. Monitor transaction performance
4. Optimize gas usage for parallel execution
